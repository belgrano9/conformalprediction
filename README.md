# Conformal Prediction Resources and Learning

Welcome to the Conformal Prediction repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing resources and documenting my journey in learning about Conformal Prediction. **Please note that this repository is currently under construction, and new content will be added regularly.**

## Overview

Conformal Prediction is a framework that provides a measure of confidence for predictions made by machine learning models. It ensures that the predictions are reliable and interpretable, offering a practical approach to quantifying uncertainty in various predictive tasks.

I started this repo to keep track of my advances. I first heard about conformal prediction 1 year ago. Since then I have tried to push it in my current job. However slow I have decided in the summer of 2024 to show how useful it could be.
